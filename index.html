 <h1><strong>Tiktok</strong></h1>

    <h3><strong>Tiktok</strong> is one of the most popular online social media sources to this day. </h3>
       <p><em>Tiktok</em> provides millions of videos posted daily that is personalized to what
        everyone wants. On <em>Tiktok</em>, it provides a complex algorithm that is impossible 
        to replicate since it tracks every interaction to the screen. For example,
        when you scroll to a new video, it tracks down to the milisecond on how long 
        you are watching. It also sees if you like a video, it will eventually show
        something very similar and tracks how you interact to that as well so it will
        keep tracking stuff to see what you like to see so you see it frequently.</p>
       
        <p><em>Tiktok</em> is used by millions of people daily from this complex algorithm. 
        People get everything they want just by how they interact to it. Searching,
        time spent on each video, liking, following, sharing, etc all help provide
        the system to what it wants to show again in the future. When you post a video, it 
        it shown to a small amount of people at first to see the engagement with the video.
        If theres a certain percent of people who engage with it in that small amount of time,
        then it shows it to more people. People do love how this app works mainly because of 
        this one big aspect that changes everything.</p>
